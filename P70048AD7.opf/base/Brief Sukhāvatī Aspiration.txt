Brief Sukhāvatī Aspiration
by Gyalse Shenpen Taye

Namo dīpaṃkarāya!
gyal kün tukjé rang zuk pema jung
Padmākara, who embodies all the buddhas’ compassion,
nga dö dro la lhakpar jé tsewé
With special care for beings of this age of fivefold strife,
ngurmik dzinpé gar gyi namrol pa
Manifested in the form of one who wears the saffron robes—
nyammé jowo jé la solwa deb
Incomparable lord Atiśa, to you I pray!

gön khyö gyepé chen gyi lek zik né
Protector, may you regard us well with your happy gaze,
tsewé chak gi dak sok dro kün gyi
And with your loving hands dispel my own and others’ flaws,
lé nyön dribpé drima kün sal né
The obscurations caused by karma and the afflictions,
dechen dakpé shying du drenpar dzö
And lead us all to Sukhāvatī, pure land of perfect bliss!

This was written by the monk Shenpen Tayé to fulfil the request of Chakla Kusho Dorje Rabten.
